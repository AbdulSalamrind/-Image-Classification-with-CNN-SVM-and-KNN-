# Image Classification with CNN, SVM, and KNN

## Project Description

This project demonstrates image classification using a variety of machine learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision and has applications in fields such as object recognition, medical image analysis, and more.

### Key Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A CNN model is implemented for image classification. CNNs are deep learning models specifically designed to work with image data.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A Support Vector Machine classifier is employed for image classification. Grid search is used to optimize hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is utilized for image classification, offering a simple yet effective approach.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** The project provides performance metrics, including accuracy, and visualizations like confusion matrices to assess and compare the models' performance.

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The code includes functions for loading image data, resizing images, and preparing them for training and testing.

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** These libraries are used for data visualization, enabling you to understand the models' behavior and results.

This project serves as an educational resource and a practical example for those interested in image classification and machine learning. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced practitioner seeking insights into different algorithms, this codebase is a valuable resource.
